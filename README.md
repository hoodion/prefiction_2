# Prefiction Preview (local)

Minimal Vite + React + Tailwind project containing the PREFICTION preview component.

Run locally (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\anand\OneDrive\Desktop\Prefiction -2"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

Notes:
- The component uses Tailwind CSS and `framer-motion` for animations.
- This is a minimal scaffold to preview the component in the browser.
